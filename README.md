## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I? â›‘
Just a pragmatic developer focused on the backend side of development. I wish I am on the right way to finally be a "senior" guy. I have some plans for trying my hand as a team leader.

### What I do? â›‘
Most of my job is around working for specific companies as developer for now, however there are some interesting private projects incoming. I have ahope that being just a smart, sharp, focused I am able to build my own product some day. Product without all horrors I saw in many products in past.

### What's important? â›‘
- Keep it simple
- Keep it extensible
- Keep it clean
- Keep your development priorities sorted out
